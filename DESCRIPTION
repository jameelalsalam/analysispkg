Description: This example package shows a way to structure an
    analysis as a package. Major features include: 1) exported data to
    facilitate re-use of results, 2) major analysis steps structured as
    functions and documented using roxygen2 and pkgdown, 3) build script
    that can be used in several modes (development, clone by others, or on
    CI), 4) automated testing on C.I., 5) fallback to fixed package and
    dependency versions, 6) various output formats.
